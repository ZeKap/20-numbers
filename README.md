# Welcome at "20 numbers sorted"

In this game, you'll be given a random numbre from 0 to 1000.
You have to put it in a place between 0 and 20, and once put, you won't be able to move it.

The goal is simple: place all 20 numbers and make it so they are all sorted at the end.

This game has been made in a few hours in a night when I was bored, the code isn't beautiful but works (I even put some comments)
You can do a pull request if you're bored too but __don't take this project seriously__
